        How to Make a New Resource File for Another Language
        ----------------------------------------------------

In the zip project, we use resource files to hold the 
error messages that can be generated.  This lets us support 
more than 1 language without much trouble.

For now, these are the languages we support. 
  
   ZipMsgBR.rc - Brazilian (Portuguese)
   ZipMsgCT.rc  - Catalan
   ZipMsgDK.rc  - Danish
   ZipMsgNL.rc  - Dutch
   ZipMsgFI.rc  - Finnish
   ZipMsgFR.rc  - French
   ZipMsgDE.rc  - German
   ZipMsgHU.rc  - Hungarian
   ZipMsgNO.rc  - Norwegian
   ZipMsgPT.rc  - Polish
   ZipMsgSW.rc  - Swedish
   ZipMsgES.rc  - Spanish
   ZipMsgS1.rc  - Spanish
   ZipMsgSI.rc  - Slovenian
   ZipMsgUS.rc  - US / English 

   ZipMsgCN.rc  - Chinese [ GB(K) - commonly used in China and Singapore for
                            simplified Chinese writing.]
   ZipMsgCZ.rc  - Czech
   ZipMsgGR.rc  - Greek
   ZipMsgIT.rc  - Italian
   ZipMsgJP.rc  - Japanese
   ZipMsgMY.rc  - Malaysia
   ZipMsgRO.rc  - Romanian
   ZipMsgRU.rc  - Russian
   ZipMsgYU.rc  - Serbian (Yugoslavia)
   ZipMsgTW.rc  - Taiwanese [Big5 - commonly used in Taiwan and Hong Kong for
                             traditional Chinese writing.]

We would like YOU to help us by porting the error messages
from English into another language that we don't support yet.

The files ZipMsg.h holds the resource Id numbers, and ZipMsgUS.rc
holds the source for the English text error messages.

To make a resource file for a new language, follow these
steps:

1) select a 2 letter code for your language
   example: "DE" for German (Deutch)

2) Create a new source file for your messages:
   COPY ZipMsgUS.rc ZipMsgDE.rc

3) Edit your new file - translate the text to your language
   NOTEPAD ZipMsgDE.RC

4) Compile your source to make a RES file:
   C:>brcc32 ZipMsgDE.RC

5) E-mail me your new .RC and .RES files! Tell me the full 
   name of the new language, and your full name and e-mail address.
   I will refer to your name and address in the help file unless
   you tell me not to.
