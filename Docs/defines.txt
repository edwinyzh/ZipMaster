ZipMaster can be built with compiler conditionals that allow you to change how some things operate.

The default settings are

  [X] USE_COMPRESSED_STRINGS
  [_] STATIC_LOAD_DELZIP_DLL

Set USE_COMPRESSED_STRINGS to store the string resources compressed in the .res file instead of as ResourceStrings.
 
When you want to work with static binding define the STATIC_LOAD_DELZIP_DLL directive.
Make sure that the component, and the Delphi IDE, can find DelZip192.dll .
 ( Either in the Windows System directory or in the same directory as your application executable. 
The IDE may require it to be either in the 'bpl' or the 'bin' directory depending upon version. )
