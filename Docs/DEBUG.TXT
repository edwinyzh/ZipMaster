Notes on debugging your application using TZipMaster or TZipBuilder:


If there's anything wrong with your event handler procedures,
you may get an error message from Windows saying something
is wrong with one of the DLLs.


This is because the DLLs become the "active program" when they
are busy, and your event handlers are "slave" functions/procedures.
Any serious errors in your event handlers will be reported as 
problems with the "active program", which is the DLL.


I made a special ability for you to "Trace" thru the DLLs! This 
does not require any knowledge of the C language, and you don't
need the source code. The DLL's have a built-in ability to report
their status at various key points and you can see these status
messages by hooking the OnMessage event. Just set the Trace property
to True, hook the OnMessage event handler, and you can see what is
going on inside the DLLs!
